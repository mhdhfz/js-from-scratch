                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
                that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
                high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
                has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                object-orientation, and first-class functions

                The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion,
                sometimes giving the impression that it is a spin-off of Java.
                Since Java was the hot new programming language at the time,
                this has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to
                give its own new language cachet

              <h2>Features of Javascript : Promises</h2>

                JavaScript also supports promises, which are a way of handling
                asynchronous operations. There is a built-in Promise object that
                gives access to a lot of functionalities for handling promises,
                and defines how they should be handled. It allows one to
                associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual
                success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods
                return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately
                returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a
                promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
                Recently, combinator methods were introduced in the JavaScript
                specification, which allows developers to combine multiple
                JavaScript promises and do operations on the basis of different
                scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race,
                Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any.
